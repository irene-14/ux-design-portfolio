# My Google UX Design Professional Certificate Journey

## Welcome!

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my repository, where I’m documenting my journey through the **Google UX Design Professional Certificate**. This is where I’m keeping track of everything I’ve learned, all the projects I’ve worked on, and the notes I’ve taken along the way. It’s been an exciting ride so far, and I’m thrilled to share it with you!

## What You’ll Find Here

This repo is organized by the different courses in the certificate program. Each course has its own folder where you’ll find my notes and the projects I’ve completed. Here’s how it’s laid out:

- **[Course 1: Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design](./Course1-Intro-to-UX/)**
  - **Notes**
  - **Project**: Work in progress ⏳

- **[Course 2: Start the UX Design Process: Empathize, Define, and Ideate](./Course2-Interaction-Design/)**
  - **Notes**
  - **Project**: Work in progress ⏳

*(And I’ll keep adding more as I go!)*


## Tools I’m Using

- **Figma**: My go-to for all things design.
- **Markdown**: For writing down notes and keeping this repo organized.
- **Git/GitHub**: To keep everything versioned and backed up.

## About the Certificate

This certificate program from Google is all about teaching the fundamentals of UX design. It’s been really hands-on, with a focus on real-world projects and user-centered design. I’m learning how to take a design from concept to prototype, using research and testing to guide the way.

By the time I’m done, I’ll have a solid portfolio of work that shows my skills and creativity in UX design.
